# FlipZon

This project was made, during my Advanced Programming course, using advanced Programming concepts 
in Java.

The Great Indian Festival Season has begun and young entrepreneurs of our institute have just
started their startup, “FLIPZON”. It’s a product based start-up where people can buy a plethora
of products and get them delivered at home. “FLIPZON” founders Beff Jezos and Gill Bates
want this product to be revolutionary and want you to build an application for the same.
I have employed OOP principles, e.g., interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, whichever
provides the best and most appropriate design.

Concepts used - Interfaces, Inheritance, abstract classes, Exception Handling
function overriding and function overloading (polymorphism) Encapsulation

The Program is developed on the basis of studying most common ecommerce companies
It implements Admin and Customer Interfaces
